The Location app includes the following features:

    Add Location: Users can add a city name, description, and rating, which are stored in Firebase Firestore.
    Display Locations: Shows a list of locations with name, description, and rating. Users can tap a location to see it on a map.
    Map View: Displays a map with the selected city's location.
    Search Function: Allows users to search for countries and capitals using an external API.
    Firebase Integration: Uses Firebase Firestore for real-time syncing and storage of location data.
    (I left the login feature out of this version due to technical issues with expo, as I had to redo the task a few times from almost the beginning, including the entire            repository. That's also the reason why the commits are inconsistent in this project. )
